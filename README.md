Problem Statement:   
The process of finding suitable university housing for students, teachers, and staff can be time consuming and stressful. Often, available options are limited and information is scattered 
across various platforms, leading to confusion and frustration.

Solution:    
One possible solution to the problem statement would be to develop an online apartment 
hunting platform that offers a user-friendly interface, advanced search and filter options, and 
helpful resources for renters

● Intuitive search and filter tools

● An interactive map feature

● Virtual tours

● A messaging system

● A secure and transparent payment system
